# sportABM
This is an agent-based model (ABM), which is to help in finding the best location for sport and recreational
facilities in a big city region.


Model is based on Nick Malleson Repast City ABM(nickmalleson/repastcity). I made changes mainly in agents behaviour. 
These are based on results of my survey with 1300 clients of fitness centres and swimming pools in Krakow, Poland.
