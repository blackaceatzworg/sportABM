# sportABM
This is an agent-based model (ABM), which is to help in finding the best location for sport and recreational
facilities in a big city region.


The model is mainly based on Nick Malleson's Repast City ABM(nickmalleson/repastcity). I made some changes in agents behaviour. These are based on results of my survey with 1300 clients of fitness centres and swimming pools in Krakow, Poland.
